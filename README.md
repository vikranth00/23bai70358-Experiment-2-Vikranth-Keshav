This experiment is focused on developing a basic single-page web application using React and Bootstrap.
The main objective of the experiment is to understand the concept of component-based architecture in React and how Bootstrap can be integrated to design responsive and visually appealing user interfaces. 
In this experiment, the application is structured into reusable components such as Navbar, Hero Section, Card Components, and Footer, which are combined to form a complete Home page. 
Bootstrap is used to provide styling, layout, and responsive design, while React handles the dynamic rendering of components. 
Through this experiment, the student learns how to set up a React project using Vite, organize files using a proper folder structure, apply global CSS styles, and manage version control and deployment using Git and GitHub.
